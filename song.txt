[Intro]
Whoa, oh, oh, whoa, hey baby, yeah
Whoa, oh, oh, whoa

[Chorus]
Never gonna give you up
No, baby, yeah
No matter how you treat me
Can't do it, no
Never gonna give you up
No, no
So don't you think of leaving
Hey, yeah

[Verse 1]
Boy, you treat me bad, and I know why
Oh, you thought you saw me running around with another guy
And you think if you hurt that I will go away
Made it up in my mind that I'm here to stay, yeah

[Chorus]
Never gonna give you up
And I never, no no
No matter how you treat me
I never
Never gonna give you up
I can't do it, baby
So don't you think of leaving
Hey, hey
Don't you understand what you're doing to this woman?
